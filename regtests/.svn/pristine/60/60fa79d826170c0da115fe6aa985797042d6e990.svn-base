Regtests for the QM/MM interface and Gromos/Amber force
field to be intended for the CPMD code.

Test: ATP system (ref. JACS 128,16798-16807, 2006)
      of the type give at the QM/MM tutorial at EPFL
      excluding metal cations (K, Mg).
      QM subsystem = 3 P atoms, 15 O atoms, 12 H atoms,
                     1 C atom.
      Interface: 1 H-like link atom for C or
                 1 OECP for C

Structure of the present subdirectories:
./regtest-qmmm-|-amber-|-blyp-|-linkH
               |       |      |-oecp
               |       |-hcth
               |       |-cnstr
               |       |-metadyn
               |
               |-gromos-|-linkH
                        |-oecp

For AMBER force field: Regtests with link atoms(linkH), 
            optimized effective core potentials(oecp),
            BLYP(blyp) and HCTH(hcth) functionals,
            constrained dynamics and fixed atoms(cnstr),
            metadynamics(metadyn)

For GROMOS force field: Regtests with link atoms(linkH),
            optimized effective core potentials(oecp)

In each subdirectory, tests are done for CPMD, BOMD,
SPLIT/NOSPLIT QM/MM options, etc. and a README file
is present for each subdir.

Note: We should ignore the message
 WARNING!!!  Box too small in x direction
  X DIRECTION:  CELLDIM =    15.0000; XMAX-XMIN=    10.6204
 WARNING!!!  Box too small in y direction
  Y DIRECTION:  CELLDIM =    25.5000; YMAX-YMIN=    19.3003
 WARNING!!!  Box too small in z direction
  Z DIRECTION:  CELLDIM =    18.0000; ZMAX-ZMIN=    12.9999
in the output files since it is irrelevant for the regtests purpose.
