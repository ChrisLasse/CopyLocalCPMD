 With the version 4.3, we have ported some of the core-procedures to gpu. The XC procedures
 have been refactored and it was added the possibility to link to libxc.
+Coulomb-attenuated functionals (CAM) and the Minnesota functionals (M05, M06, M08 and
+M11 families) are now available as internal xc procedures.
 A new development for Eherenfest dynamics with ionized states is deployed.

+\faqquestion{minnesotaconv}
+I am trying to use the Minnesota functionals (M06, M11, \dots), but the results I get are most erratic,
+or they require very high values for the \refkeyword{CUTOFF}.
+What is wrong?
+
+\faqanswer
+The Minnesota functionals require unusually dense integration grids. Simply increasing the cutoff will
+introduce numerical noise and make the wavefunction optimisation unstable. This issue can be overcome by
+increasing the \refkeyword{DUAL} up to 8-12. A detailled assessment of these effects along with recommendations
+for appropriate values can be found in the following reference: M.P. Bircher, P. Lopez-Tarifa and U. Rothlisberger:
+\emph{J.\ Chem.\ Theory Comput.}, \textbf{15} (1), 557 (2019). DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00897
+
+\faqquestion{minnesotacomp}
+Results obtained from the Minnesota functionals (M05, M06, M08, M11) seem well converged, but exhibit significant differences with
+respect to Gaussian bases. Is there something wrong?
+
+\faqanswer
+Due to their highly flexible functional form, the Minnesota functionals are extremely sensitive to the
+choice and flexibility of the underlying basis set. Since Gaussian functions always impose a certain rigidity,
+results obtained in Gaussian basis sets may occasionally differ by more than just chemical accuracy from the
+plane wave results. This effect is not limited to plane waves, it can also be observed - to a lesser extent -
+when comparing plane waves and Slater functions, and can be rather pronounced when comparing Gaussian and Slater functions.
+A detailled study of basis set effects is provided in the following article: M.P. Bircher, P. Lopez-Tarifa and U. Rothlisberger:

+\faqquestion{hfxslow}
+I am running a calculation with exact exchange, but it is exceedingly slow compared to a GGA or MGGA run.
+Can this issue be resolved?
+
+\faqanswer
+The implementation of exact (or Hartree-Fock) exchange in CPMD is highly efficient and parallel. If the number of
+available nodes is limited, increasing the value in \refspekeyword{HFX\_BLOCK\_SIZE}{HFX BLOCK SIZE} can substantially speed up
+the calculation. In the presence of ample computational resources, the calculation can be sped up by using
+\refspekeyword{CP\_GROUPS}{CP GROUPS}.
+
+In isolated systems, the calculation can be sped up by up to an additional order of magnitude by using the coordinate-scaling
+scheme by Bircher and Rothlisberger. For details, see \refkeyword{SCEX}.
